Installing and Using Image Manipulator

Once you have downloaded and unzipped the project file, navigate to its directory 
in terminal and install the camlimages library: 

  $ opam install camlimages

Next, upload a .ppm file of your choice to /bin.

Build the project: 

  $ dune build

Open the project in utop:

  $ dune utop
  # #use "bin/main.ml";;

To transform your provided list to grayscale, use transform_lst:

    # transform_lst "<YOUR FILE NAME>.ppm";;

Next, check /bin for "transformed.ppm". This is your image transformed to grayscale.
